    <ul>
        <li>1 cup almond flour</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups powdered sugar</li>
        <li>3 egg whites</li>
        <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>Food coloring (optional)</li>
        <li>Buttercream, ganache, or jam for filling</li>
        <li>Piping bag with a round tip</li>
        <li>Parchment paper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        Steps 
    </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 300°F (150°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Sift the almond flour and powdered sugar together into a large bowl, ensuring there are no lumps.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until they form soft peaks.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the granulated sugar to the egg whites while continuing to beat, achieving stiff peaks.</li>
        <li>Gently fold the sifted dry ingredients into the egg whites in three parts, using a spatula, to avoid deflating the mixture.</li>
        <li>If desired, add a few drops of food coloring and mix gently.</li>
        <li>Transfer the macaron batter to a piping bag with a round tip.</li>
        <li>Pipe 1 1/2-inch circles onto the parchment-lined baking sheet, spaced about 2 inches apart.</li>
        <li>Tap the baking sheet on the counter several times to release any air bubbles.</li>
        <li>Allow the piped macarons to rest for 30 minutes to form a skin, which is crucial for the formation of "feet" during baking.</li>
        <li>Bake the macarons in the preheated oven for 15-18 minutes, or until they are set and have formed feet.</li>
        <li>Allow the macarons to cool completely on the baking sheet before removing.</li>
        <li>Once cooled, fill the macarons with buttercream, ganache, or jam, and sandwich them together.</li>
    </ol>
